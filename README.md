# Simple PHP Router
Do you work with core PHP? Then you need a router through which you can manage all the URLs of your website. I did a lot of searching online where there is no router that works just fine. So I gave myself one I hope will work.

## Features

- Redirect URL by URI.
- Redirect to 404 Not found page if there is no page available.
